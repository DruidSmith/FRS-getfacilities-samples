FRS-getfacilities-samples
=========================

Sample code for using the USEPA Facilities Registry Service (FRS) GetFacilities REST Service

These code samples are intended to demonstrate different ways in which the FRS GetFacilities REST service can be used.  These code samples all demonstrate integration using only HTML and JavaScript.  No back-end integration is needed.  Additionally, all additional libraries in these code samples are open-source, for example jQuery, which is used as the framework for all of the queries in these examples.  Additionally, the mapping demos use Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap.  These samples can easily be modified to for example use the Bing Maps API, or other libraries.

The use cases being demonstrated include:

performing a radial search based on a coordinate and user-specified radius; 

performing a query for facilities based on name and address; 

searching and retrieving information based on a specific program system ID (in this case, a state or other external identifier)
